# IGNCodeFoolTask
I did it! I made a real-time polling app that anyone in the world can access and see the up-to-date changes.

It is easy to compile. Simply run "npm run dev" can do the job.

Since I have changed the running environment from local to the internet. 
If you want to run the app locally, it will stil compile but won't receive the data from the database.

So please change the line 333 and 357 in main.js file inside the brackets fetch('...') to fetch('http://localhost:3000/poll').

Or you can simply go to https://igntasks.herokuapp.com/ to see how this app performs.

For the first task, I included my answers in "Hisui's New Power Plant.txt".

Thank you!
